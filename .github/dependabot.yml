Sure! Below is an example of a `dependabot.yml` configuration file for a Substrate chain written in Rust. Dependabot helps you keep your dependencies up to date by automatically creating pull requests when new versions are available.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "cargo"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    rebase-strategy: "auto"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      prefix-development: "chore"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
    reviewers:
      - "psyferlab"

  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    rebase-strategy: "auto"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      prefix-development: "chore"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
    reviewers:
      - "psyferlab"

  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
    rebase-strategy: "auto"
    commit-message:
      prefix: "deps"
      prefix-development: "chore"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
    reviewers:
      - "psyferlab"
